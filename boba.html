                <h2>A Short History of Cars</h2>
                <p>
                    The first practical automobiles appeared in the late 1800s, powered by early internal combustion
                    engines. In the 1900s, mass production transformed cars from luxury products into everyday tools.
                    Over time, innovations like automatic transmissions, anti-lock brakes, fuel injection, and airbags
                    made cars easier and safer to drive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, the industry is shifting again with electric vehicles, advanced driver assistance systems,
                    and software-defined features. Modern cars combine mechanical engineering with computing power in a
                    way that would have looked impossible a few decades ago.
